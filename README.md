# World Population Analysis and Details on EU

The world's population is always changing, and migration is playing a big part in this, including the European Union (EU). The EU has seen some interesting changes in its population recently. Even though the population is increasing in the EU and, in some places, has been decreasing, the overall population is still growing. This makes us curious about the role migration might be playing in this growth.

In this study, we want to explore how migration might be affecting the population growth in the EU. By looking at the data and analyzing it, we hope to find valuable insights that can contribute to addressing these issues effectively.
